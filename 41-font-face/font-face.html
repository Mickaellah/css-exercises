    <ol>
      <li>Font file formates:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>WOFF2</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>EOT</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>OTF</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>SVG</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        WOFF and WOFF2 are good candidates to use in all browsers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The difference between @font-face and the other @-blocks are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            We don't need to give a name with @font-face and don't need to use querrie.
          </li>
          <li>Some @font-face need licence whereas other @-blocks don't need.</li>
          <li>
            @font-face cannot be declared within a CSS selector.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Licencing restrictions</b><br>
        This means that fonts cannot be used without permission from whose people who created the fonts.
      </li>
      <li>
        To supprort all those chosen fonts, we need to make the use of 8 font-face blocks
      </li>
      <li>
        Our users have to download 160KB in the example above.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we chose to offer WOFF2 as well as WOFF, we need to have 16 files to specify: <br>
        <u>Eg</u>:<br>
        <code>
          @font-face {
            font-family: Roboto;
            src: url('./Roboto.woff2') format(woff2),
                 url('./Roboto.woff') format(woff);
          }
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        For us to be sure that user's browser doesn't download the fonts they might already have, we place the <code>local()</code> functon before placing <code>url()</code> to check whether the device already has the font saved locally, and if not, to download it from the source specified in the <code>url();</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes we have to assign fallback fonts for our custom webfonts we add via @font-face. We have do bear in mind that we should always use the same type the font for its fallback or not really different from its other.
      </li>
      <li>
        We can render fallback font firs or it is just blank untill downloaded, or by using <code>font-display: ;</code>to help the browser decide on which strategy to use.
      </li>
    </ol>
