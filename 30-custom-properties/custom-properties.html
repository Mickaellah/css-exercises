      Doing some research about Custom Property.

      <li>
        When difining a Custom Property's name, we have to use two dashes <code>(--)</code> in front of the name that we are going to define, any alphanumeric ,underscore <code>(_)</code>, emojis also can be use as part of the name if that are needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Custom Property's name is the same as the othe properties, we can't use spaces, instead we use dashes and also there can't be period <code>(.)</code> in there.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are possible values that we can assign to a new Custom Property like numbers, texts, keywords, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you want to apply the Custom Property to all the elements in a document, it is good to use <code>:root</code> or <code>html</code> selector and all the elements will inherit from it, but when you want to apply the Custom Property to a specific element, it is not good to use it with the <code>:root</code> or <code>html</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        After we've defined a new Custom Property, we use the <code>var()</code> function to recall or to use that Custom Property again.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are some ways that we can change a Custom Property, we can do that by editing the <code>name</code>, <code>type</code> or its <code>value</code>, by using media querie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Custom Properties are useful because it allows CSS variable to be used in media queries, and also to write less codes, clean codes and to simplify them.
      </li>
      <li>
        The only aspect (or part) of CSS syntax that we can use Custom Properties for is the declaration block.
