              The inherit keyword with colour value inherits whatever color is specified in the parent's color property.

              Revert keyword value returns the cascaded value of property from its current value to the value the property would have had if no changes had been made by current style origin to the current element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Initial keyword value applies the initial (or default) value of a property to an element. This initial value is set by browser. It can be applied to any CSS properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unset keyword value resets a property to its inherited value if its parent, and to its initial value if not. It can be applied to any CSS property,including the CSS shorthand all.

            Any danger when using inherit as a value.

        <p>
          Inherit value doesn't work in some properties and cause something that you are not expected. Inherit is not supported in some browsers, using inherit as a value may cause errors if the browser doesn't support inherit.
