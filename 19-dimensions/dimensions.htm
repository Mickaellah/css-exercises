              The diffault values of:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Min-width is 0.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Max-width is none.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Min-height is 0.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Max-height is none.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              The max-width overrides width and min-width overrides max-width. The max-height overrides height and min-height overrides max-height.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even if your width value is less than min-width value, it will be fine, it won't have any effect since it will be overridden by the min-width value.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the element is a block-like or an inline-like element the value of the width or height change.
            </li>
            <li>
              When your min-width is greater than your max-width, it is still working but in the wrong way, I mean in the way than your are not mean it to be.
            </li>
            <li>
              When widths are applied to table cells, and the content inside these cells doesn't fit, so it overflows and the text in the cell flows over its.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you set the height to a numeric value as percentagrs and when a content of an element with it is to big and doesn't fit in the specified height, it will overflow.
            </li>
            <li>
              The interesting characteristics with the ruleset in the index.md are the units of the two values are not the same and also the max-width is greater than the min-width.
            </li>
            <li>
              The implied width of a div is the max-width.
            </li>
          </ul>
