            By default, grid have one column to work on.
          </li>
          <li>
            The difference between flexbox and grid are:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Flexbox was invented for layout in one dimention, either a row or a column.
              </li>
              <li>
                Grid was invented for two-dimentional layout, rows and columns at the same time.
              </li>
            </ol>
            And also flexbox can align elements along a baseline while grid layout cannot do that.
          </li>
          <li>
            We would like to use flexbox rather than grid because flexbox is the best way to arrange elements in either an single row or single column.
          </li>
          <li>
            We choose to use grid rather than flexbox because grit is the best way to arrange elements in multiple rows and coumns.
          </li>
          <li>
            The short way to write out: <code>grid-template-columns: 10rem 10rem 10rem 10rem;</code> is <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(4 10rem);.</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            To specify a minimum height for a grid row we can use the minmax() function with grid-template-row.
          </li>
        </ul>
