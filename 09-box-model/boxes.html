          For most design work, designers are always use the box model to create the beauty of their work.

          Box model is a big box which is used to wrap all the boxes in every HTML element like (margin, border, padding and content-box). This property seems to cover all of those properties which I have told before. According to google we also can say that box model can be used as a toolkit for customising the layout of different elements, and also box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

          Box model is really important because all design works need box model for every HTML element.
