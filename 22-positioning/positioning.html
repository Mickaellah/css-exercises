          Static is the diffault value of position property.

          <ul>
            <li>
              When we are using any non-default position value, we need to supply width and height first.
            </li>
            <li>
              The inferred display value of an element that has been positioned is inline-block.
            </li>
            <li>
              I think absolute position is the one which still maintains a box in the flow of the documen because it is said that this value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse with other margins.
            </li>
            <li>
              The something which makes fixed and sticky positioning is that they always create a new stacking context.
            </li>
            <li>
              We can use top and right properties to lock an element absolutely position's coordinates to its parent element.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
