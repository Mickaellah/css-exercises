      Dig into transitions.

        Transition property is a shorthand property of <code>transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function and transition-delay.</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        The difference between a timing function, delay and duration is
        <ul>
          <li>
            Timing function is the speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delay is the duration of the waiting time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Duration is the length of time it will take.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In CSS, all the properties that are using any numeric values can be animated by using transition.
      </li>
      <li>
        We can select more than one property to transition at a time by using the all keyword or putting comma to separate them.
      </li>
      <li>
        To define the desire state, we use the <code>pseudo classes</code>like <code>:hover, :active, :focus, :target, :checked</code>, or just use any selectors different from the other one.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do need transitions, and they are useful because they give a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transition became a problem when you are in a rush.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transitions don't work reliably with the auto keyword being one of the end states because animation only work with any numeric value.
      </li>
      <li>
        For us to stage transition we set the <code>transition-delay</code> for each single element.
      </li>
    </ol>
